## Project Description
Bucket List is a community-led website that allows users to share, create and search for bucket list ideas to put on their own customised bucket list. 

A Bucket List is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime before they kick the bucket.

Users can register on the landing page and log in to the site in order to view these different ideas. They can then add these ideas to their Bucket List. Or, if they have already completed an experience, they can add it to their Done It list

This website is the third of four Milestone Projects that make up the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Program. The main Technologies used for the site are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB


## UX: 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a full-stack site that users can make use of. I want users to clearly understand how the site works and create a community of users that can create, save, and search for bucket list ideas through the site.  

The secondary goal of this project is to strengthen my knowledge of Python, Flask and MongoDB. I am hoping that the challenge of developing this site will allow me to understand these three elements of the course more clearly.
