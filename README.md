## Project Description
Bucket List is a community-led website that allows users to share, create and search for bucket list ideas to put on their own customised bucket list. 

A Bucket List is a number of experiences or achievements that a person hopes to have or accomplish during their lifetime before they kick the bucket.

Users can register on the landing page and log in to the site in order to view these different ideas. They can then add these ideas to their Bucket List. Or, if they have already completed an experience, they can add it to their Done It list

This website is the third of four Milestone Projects that make up the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Program. The main Technologies used for the site are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask and MongoDB


## UX: 
### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a full-stack site that users can make use of. I want users to clearly understand how the site works and create a community of users that can create, save, and search for bucket list ideas through the site.  

The secondary goal of this project is to strengthen my knowledge of Python, Flask and MongoDB. I am hoping that the challenge of developing this site will allow me to understand these three elements of the course more clearly. 

### User Stories

The main target audience can be broken into two groups: regular players and other software developers/recruiters interested in how the website was made. 

#### Regular User
As a regular user, I want: 
1. A visually appealing site no matter what device I use.
2. The ability to easily navigate through the site the first time I visit.
3. The site’s purpose to be clear once I see the landing page so I can decide if I want to register or not
4. The ability to log in and out of the site once I am registered
5. The ability to search for bucket list ideas on the site by experience name, or by experience category. 
6. The ability to view more information on a certain experience if I am interested in it. 
7. The ability to create experiences that are not already on the site, so I can share them with the community. 
8. The ability to edit an experience if I have made an error when creating it. 
9. The ability to delete an experience I have created.
10. The ability to add an experience to my own customised bucket list that I can view on my profile. 

#### Software Developer/Recruiter
As a software developer/recruiter, I want: 
1. To view the developer’s Linked In profile
2. To view the developer’s GitHub repository for the project so I can look into their code
3. The ability to examine the creator’s ReadMe for more details on how the project was created.
4. View the site and play around with its features. 


#### Developer Goals 
My personal goals for this project are as follows: 

As a developer, I want to: 
1. Develop a deeper understanding of Python, MongoDB, and Flask by creating an original project with CRUD functionality.
2. Create a professional looking project that I will be proud to put in my portfolio.

### Wireframes 
I used Balsamiq wireframes to visualise how the site would be structured on different devices. 

These wireframes were a useful reference when I began developing the basic structure for the website.

You can view the wireframes below.

* [Landing Page](static/images/wireframes/landing-page.jpg)
* [Edit Experience](static/images/wireframes/edit-experience.jpg)
* [Edit Profile](static/images/wireframes/edit-profile.jpg)
* [Experiences Info](static/images/wireframes/experience-info.jpg)
* [Home Page](static/images/wireframes/home-page.jpg)
* [Landing Page](static/images/wireframes/landing-page.jpg)
* [Profile](static/images/wireframes/profile.jpg)
* [Search Page](static/images/wireframes/search-page.jpg)

It is important to note that I did not do a wireframe for certain pages like the admin page, the log-in page, and the register page. The reason for this was a lack of adequate planning since the project deadline was due within 5 weeks of me starting the project. This meant that I rushed the initial planning of the project more than I should have and came across certain design problems as a result. 

Also, as you can see from the wireframes, there have been some changes to certain features when I began developing the pages. 

## Features 
### General Design Choices
#### Colour Palette
The three main colours I chose for the website are displayed in hex format below

* Orange #ff6a3d: Used for the website brand, the font awesome icons, and the buttons on the website
* Navy #1a2238: Used for the navbar, the footer, and the badges that display the experience categories on the experience cards. 
* White #f8f8fb: Used for the font colour for buttons and nav-links on the site. I also used it for the social links in the footer. 
* Black #101112: Used for the majority of the font colours on the site. 

#### Fonts
I used two different fonts for this website

* ['Crimson Text', serif:]( https://fonts.google.com/?query=crimson+text) Used for the website headings
* ['Work Sans', sans-serif:]( https://fonts.google.com/?query=work+sans) Used for all other font elements of the website.
